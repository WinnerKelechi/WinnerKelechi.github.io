                As an HR , Stride ERP helps to manage a lot of employee data,
Helps me track employee attendance with the punch-in/out feature.
Also helps in storing employee files and also in employee performance appraisals.
It's also helpful in Payroll management as I don't worry about computing employee financial record monthly.<br>
Most importantly, I don't always have to be in the office to access this amazing application because it's a web-based application
I highly recommend this software for all businesses
